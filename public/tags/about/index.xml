      <description>This blog is basically a “note to myself” space. I note down bits and pieces about things I did / learnt. It realy is a space for me, but it’s public, so that anyone may profit from the time I’ve spent learning about something. I just want to give back to the community and help people to learn. That’s all.
Read on to find out more about my portfolio and previous experience.</description>
