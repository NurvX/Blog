This blog is basically a “note to myself” space. I note down bits and pieces about things I did / learnt. It realy is a space for me, but it’s public, so that anyone may profit from the time I’ve spent learning about something.
I just want to give back to the community and help people to learn. That’s all.

Read on to find out more about my portfolio and previous experience. You can also check out my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/NurvX) and visit my [LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/akshay-nehate/).

If you are interested in hiring me to work or would like to discuss more about me and my blog, why not [get in touch](mailto:hello@akshay.nz)?


Stay tuned.. Stay secure..
